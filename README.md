Workbook T1A1:



1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. 
You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet.

### A brief history of the Internet

#### foundation circa  1990


#### design meets function with CSS 1994


#### leading to search engines 1994

#### online shopping 1995

#### and social media

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential 
in terms of the development of the internet:
 - packets
 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - routers and routing
 - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

### definitions

#### packets

These are blocks of information that are sent and received between multiple sites.
they carry information regarding style, layout and any information that you are
viewing.

Packets allow the data creators use to style and format websites the be broken down and reassembled
making loading a website more managable 

#### IP adresses (IPv4 & IPv6)

IP stands for Internet Protocol and are the unique address' that your device has, 
similar to a mailing address at a house, it's used to identify where to send data there 
are 2 different types.

the IPv4 is a series of 32 binary bits that create a code, four digits separated with dot points
for example 0.1.2.3 

IPv4 was implemented first but with the rapid expansion of the internet in the late 90s and 2000 
was expanded due to concerns that there would be enough IPv4 addresses. IPv6 uses 128 binary bits 
and is represented by 8 groups of 4 separated with dashes. For example 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

#### routers

Routing is the process of finding the most efficient way for information to be sent and recieved 
between two sources, like a browser viewing a website; the information is recieved in packets 
and assembled again.

Routers are the networking device that connects to the internet and directs the data between 
computer networks. Routers have developed a lot over the life of the internet allowing connections 
to faster infrastructure and even allowing wireless connections as well 

#### DNS

Domain name systems are a protocol that dictates how computers networks exchange data and converts domain names 
in to IP addresses. 

Devices use DNS servers to look up the domain name that they are trying to connect to 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - TCP
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet

### definitions 2

#### TCP

Transmission control protocol establishes and controls the link between 2 computer networks. This protocol manages flow
control, dictating how the packets can be securely sent and  are reassembled for the client in the form of a 
website or document.

TCP is the  is one the key components of the internet as it establishes the standard order in which information
is securely transported between the consumer and the service or site they are trying to access 

#### HTTP & HTTPS

Hypertext transfer protocol and it's secure extension are the convention in which messages and information are sent 
as well as the format that this information takes. If there is no information at the requested source, like a file
does not exist or the URL is misspelled then this protocol will return an error, usually in the form of "404 Page 
not found".

HTTPS is an updated, more secure version of this. in 1999, the World Wide Web Consortium documented the issues with
the then current transfer protocols and by 2014 Google HTTPS to be a ranking factor for how sites were listed on
their search engine.

#### web browser

This is an application that is utilised to access the internet, there primary role is to render HTML. To do this 
the computer network requests data from another IP address, the packets are then sent. A process called the 
Critical Rendering Path is then used to show the HTML then the CSS in the browser.

Browsers also include tools that allow the user to view the underlying code. In a browser such as Google Chrome, 
the information can be viewed and manipulated on the users browser allowing them to make temporary changes 
without affecting the website. This can also be used to see how a website reacts under different conditions, 
like a mobile device screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

### data types 

The three major data structures that are utilized are classes, Arrays and hashes. 

#### Class - "class.new"

Classes are a customer data structure type. These can be used to assign value as well as create objects,
classes are defined with a keyword followed by the class name and then assigned attributes.

The class data type is mainly used to create a custom object to work with.

#### Array "[]"

Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a variable as well as represent a list of values. These values
are called elements, these elements can be called individually from the array or the whole array can be returned. 

An array is used as a container for many kinds of object or data types, like intergers or strings 

#### Hashes "{}"

similarly to arrays, hashes are used to store multiple values, but these values are given keys. The keys can be 
used to access the data, like the class name is used to access the attributes assigned to it. 

Hashes are used to convert a key in to an interger of limited range

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

#### interpreters and compilers

compiler:
A compiler is a program that converts high level code in to machine code. This is process takes the human readable
code, like the information used to create a program in Ruby and changes it in to binary, the computer then 
processes the corresponding task. Because the compiler has already translated in to machine code it takes less
time to run the executable file. 

interpreter:
an interpreter is a program that utilises source code, pre-compiled code and script to convert each high level
programming statement into machine code, it is easier to utilise as it shows the user when an error occurs.

Where a compiler will anaylise each each statement, then continue processing if there are no errors, link the exe
files then run the program. An interpreter will run the executable file without linking files and the program is
then run line by line when it's executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

#### languages

Python:
this is a high level coding language, meaning that it uses more generalised, understandable terms in order to 
create programs. Python was designed in 1990 by Guido Van Rossum with an emphasis on making readable code and is
an object oriented language.

Python revolves around 5 core ideas:

"Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Readability counts."

As stated in the Zen of Python, a document written by Tim Peters. This also outlines the benefits of Python,
it allows the user to write code that is readable, simplistic, is easily explainable and looks good, It is 
also an open source program, meaning it is free and has a very active community around it.

However, this language is slower than some other programming languages and depends on third party framework meaning,
that if the user wants to user certain tools in the program, they need to install another program. Additionally
Python isn't developed for mobile computing, although it can be used for this purpose this also requires addition plugins.


Ruby:
Developed in 1995 by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, another high level language that supports procedural, object-oriented and 
functional programming. Designed around a philosophy of productivity and fun, it is more generalised and can be used to 
create myriad of programs and applications. With addition of Rails, Ruby is also mainly used as a platform for developing web 
applications.

Also being a open source program, Ruby is easily accessible and has an active community to support it's users, however this 
base is not as big as Pythons. Where it excels are blocks of existing code called Gems are developed and stored in online 
repositories, like Github or rubygems.org making it easy for users to access and implement these Gems in to their own code.

Being a flexible language means that debugging can be difficult to perform. With the online repositories, documentation for
Gems can be lacking and similarly to Python the boot and runtime speeds are slow.

7. Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically 
responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:
 - access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, 
or beliefs)
 - intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
 - criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
 - GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
 - freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
 - aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
 - trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the 
law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.

8. Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language

#### control flow

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Explain type coercion

#### type coercion

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Explain data types, using examples

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. 
The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, 
how can you build an app to replace them?”
 - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
 - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program:

```ruby
celsius = gets
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, 
it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
	i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
 1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). 
Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, 
tasks, actions, or operations
 2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:
You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the 
temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, 
if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater 
than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them 
“It’s warm and raining”.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information 
about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items 
(and their value) that were tested are:
 - eggs (1)
 - peanuts (2)
 - shellfish (4)
 - strawberries (8)
 - tomatoes (16)
 - chocolate (32)
 - pollen (64)
 - cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:
 a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
 b) the full list of allergies.
